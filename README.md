# Earthquake_Mapping

Overview of Project
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
Deliverable 4: A written report on the Mapping Earthquakes analysis README.md.

Tech-Overview
In this module, you will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.



Project Plan
Purpose The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes of a seven day period.

Tasks To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and add the data to a map.

Deliverable 1 Requirements:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

Your final map should look similar to the following image:

Deliverable 2 Requirements:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

Your final map should look similar to the following image:

Deliverable 3 Requirements:
Using your knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.

Your final map should look similar to the following image:
